"\n\nTo loop over objects in Javascript, you can use a for...in loop. The for...in loop allows you to iterate over
 the properties of an object. \n\nHere's an example 
of how to loop over an object using for...in loop:\n\n```\nconst 
myObject = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30,\n  city: \"New York\"\n}\n\nfor (let key in myObject) 
{\n  console.log(key + \": \" + myObject[key]);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example,
 we use the for...in loop to iterate over the properties of the `myObject` object. For each iteration
 of the loop, the `key` variable is set to the name of the property, and we
  can access the value of that property using `myObject[key]`. This allows us to print each
   property and its value to the console.\n\nOutput:\n```\nname: John\nage: 30\ncity: New York\n```\n\nNote: 
   It's important to use the `hasOwnProperty` method to check if the object
    has its own property before accessing it, to avoid iterating over properties
    inherited from the object's prototype. Here is an updated example:\n\n```\nconst 
    myObject = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30,\n  city: \"New York\"\n}\n\nfor (let key in myObject) 
    {\n  if (myObject.hasOwnProperty(key)) {\n    console.log(key + \": \" + myObject[key]);\n  }\n}\n```"
